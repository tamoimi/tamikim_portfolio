          Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer passionate about creating seamless,
          accessible, and pixel-perfect user interfaces that combine thoughtful
          design with solid engineering principles.

          I believe in the power of technology to create intuitive experiences,
          and I strive to build digital products that are as functional as they
          are beautiful.

            Optaum Platform
          </a>
          , a payment solutions company, where I focused on developing and
          maintaining responsive, high-performance web applications. My role
          involved ensuring that the user interfaces were not only visually
          appealing but also optimized for both performance and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before my role at Optaum, I completed an intensive 6-month Front-End
          Development course at&nbsp;

            Green Computer Academy
          </a>
          , where I gained hands-on experience in building modern, responsive
          websites and applications. This foundation laid the groundwork for my
          current work and fueled my passion for creating user-centric digital
          experiences.

        <p>
          In my spare time, you can find me experimenting with new web
          technologies, solving coding challenges, or enjoying outdoor
          activities like hiking or playing games.
